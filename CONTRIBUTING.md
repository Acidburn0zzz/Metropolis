# Contributing

I know I say contributions are welcome, but this is my anonymous internet art project. Feel free to make suggestions or additions or even "I could go work on this languauge/glyph you can't be bothered to do Chris, and then you can have final veto..". I usually do veto, because I'm an anti-social like that. I'm sorry, I don't mean any malice, but hey, I'll loose interest otherwise and then this project really will be useless to everyone. And obviously, the worst kind of veto is an un-reviewed pull request (sorry, I'm a busy guy).

The letters are the way they are because I wanted them that way. I also reserve the right to also go "this is shit, what was I thinking" and rub it out and do it again. If you don't like that, feel free to fork this project and take my name off your theft*.

Why the change of heart? As of late 2019, several high profile contributors in the open source community have been (essentially) removed from their own projects. I intend to subvert that trend. I care more about autonomy than irrelevance.

*: All great artists steal, btw ;)
