# The Metropolis Typeface

The Vision
---
To create a modern, geometric typeface. Open sourced, and openly available. Influenced by other popular geometric, minimalist sans-serif typefaces of the new millenium. Designed for optimal readability at small point sizes while beautiful at large point sizes.

The Plan
---
My current plan is:
1. Start with a 'regular' design (weight and width, as well as default metrics and glyph variations)
2. Design a 'black' weight at the above regular width to create instances at various weights
3. Start designing other widths or a light/hairline weight
4. Design 'rounded', 'slab' or other variations
