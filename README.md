# The Metropolis Typeface

The Vision
---
To create a modern, geometric typeface. Open sourced, and openly available. Influenced by other popular geometric, minimalist sans-serif typefaces of the new millenium. Designed for optimal readability at small point sizes while beautiful at large point sizes.

The Plan
---
My current plan is:

1. Complete a 'thin' weight for 9 default styles
2. Create italicized versions of the 3 master weights for 18 styles
3. Create 'rounded' and/or 'slab' or versions
